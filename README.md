## Content:

In this repository you may find two files, the one named "Japanese characters" contains our attempt at using SNN on a dataset of labeled images of Japanese characters, along with the needed data file. <br>
The second file named "Images to spikes" is our attempt on transfroming an image of the given dataset into spikes.
